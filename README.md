# Pokemon-Battle

This is a web application based off of rock, paper, scissors. The user chooses a starter pokemon, and battles the computer who chooses a Pokemon at random. The score from each battle is recorded below. Users may battle as many times as they'd like, as well as change their starter Pokemon choice.

## Lessons Learned

I'm excited to continue developing this assignment. I really want to add more pokemon options/combinations, and work on the overall visual appearance of the document. Maybe include some transitions as a play around with more CSS and JS.
